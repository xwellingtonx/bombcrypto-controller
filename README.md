# About
This is a controller I've created to help play BombCrypto Adventure Mode in mobile devices, the controler allows the user to simulate the WASD and Space keys from a normal keyboard.


# How to use?
1. Install the chorme plugin from the store like: 
2. Use the joystick by holding the white circle and moving around, this will simulate the press of WASD keys and move your hero.
2. Touch the B button to place bombs, this will simulate the SPACE key.
